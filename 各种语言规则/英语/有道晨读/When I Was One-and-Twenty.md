When I was one-and-twenty

> 那年我二十一岁

I heard a wise man say,

> 有位智者谆谆教诲：

‘Give crowns and pounds and guineas

> “王冠金银皆可以放弃，

But not your heart away;

> 切勿贸然付出真情实意；

Give pearls away and rubies

> 珍珠宝石亦可以赠人，

But keep your fancy free.’

> 切勿丢失心底希冀。”

But I was one-and-twenty,

> 那年我二十一岁，

No use to talk to me.

> 金玉良言视若儿戏。


When I was one-and-twenty


> 那年我二十一岁，

I heard him say again,

> 智者再次良言相送：

‘The heart out of the bosom

> “推心置腹待人，

Was never given in vain;

> 必不会毫无回响；

’Tis paid with sighs a plenty

> 但换来的不过是无尽的哀叹

And sold for endless rue.’

> 和绵绵不绝的懊丧。”

And I am two-and-twenty,

> 如今我已二十二岁，

And oh, ’tis true, ’tis true.

> 方知此言不虚，此言不虚
